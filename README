This is a utility for the Gentoo portage system.
With this perl script you can print or save the current setting of the
USE-Flags or compare with the setting of a saved versions.
This is the most convenient way to keep track of the changes of the
USE-Flags in the portage tree (and of the defaults in your profile).

Since the auto-useflags of use.defaults are practically deprecated,
these files are ignored by this script.

If you have installed app-portage/eix, this script will run slightly faster.

For installation, copy useflags with executable permission in your path.
To obtain support for zsh completion, you can copy _useflags to a
directory of zsh's $fpath
There is also an ebuild in the mv overlay (which is available by layman).
